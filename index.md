### DATASET LINK

[COVID-19 Dataset Countries aggregated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/covid-19/main/data/countries-aggregated.csv)

I prefer this dataset because it shows COVID-19 increasing and decreasing pattern of cases in various countries. The dataset is having various countries and if compare the initial patterns of the countries we could save people from facing worst conditions. The different patterns could also give solutions before facing the after effects. The dataset also provides the information of countries which got freed from COVID-19 also.

### DATA SCIENCE BOOK LINK

[Deep Learning a MIT Press Book by Ian GoodFellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

I choose this data science book because of its content. The book is divided into three parts Part 1: Applied Maths And Machine Learning Basics which will teach us applied maths and machine learning basics which include Linear Algebra, Probablity and information theory, Numerical computation and machine learning basics. So this part is just the start and covers initial knowledge required for the understanding of Deep learning. Part 2: Modern Practical Deep Networks which will provide us the knowledge basics of neural networks and deep learning starting from Deep Feedforward Networks to Convolution networks and finally applications. Basically this part is perfect blend of theoritical and practical applications of deep neural networks which will help us to gain knowledge at it's best. Part 3: Deep Learning Research is containing all new things which are advance level and are new in the field of deep neural networks. The main reason behind choosing this book that the book provided knowledge from the basics to the advanced and new concepts. I have sufficient level of knowledge of basic concepts so this book will help me to gain more knowledge at advanced levels.   

### CAREER OBJECTIVE

To obtain a position that will enable me to use my strong organizational skills, educational background, and ability to work well with people & a positive contribution to the 
organization. Work in research and development for the betterment of society and the country.


###  PROJECTS

**Project Area**: Opinion Analysis of electric vehicle using Machine Learning(Research Paper Published in International Research and Journals, Pune, India) 

**Tools Used**: Python3 and Google Colab 

**Monetary Benefit**: The basic idea behind this research was to consider a view of people about electric vehicle. The major output was time required to charge the electric vehicle must be reduced. 


**Project Area**: Face Mask Detection

**Tools Used**: Python

**Monetary Benefit**: This was software used to check whether the person entering the premises of the company was wearing a mask or not and if not he was not allowed to enter premises. 

**Project Area**: COVID-19 Patient Status Analysis

**Tools Used**: Python3 and Google Colab 

**Monetary Benefit**: Predicting the status of the covid-19 patient using his features like age, gender, time of admission, and many more. Status like whether he is recovered, dead or still affected.

**Project Area**: Appointment portal

**Tools Used**: Python3, Jupyter Notebook, and Tkinter

**Monetary Benefit**: Appointment is requested by the appointee and then the manager’s assistant assigns the appointee a scheduled appointment by mail.  

**Project Area**: Face Recognition 

**Tools Used**: Python3, Jupyter Notebook 

**Concepts Used**: Machine Learning Algorithms, Principal component analysis, Clustering.

**Monetary Benefit**: Recognized with 90+ accuracy  Concepts of feature reduction and dimensionality reduction was used.  It first captures 10 images of any person and with the concepts of PCA and clustering, it saves the features of that person with the help of a pickle file.  For recognition, we just need to click one photo and it will show the name. 

### About My Story 

Inspired by the aforementioned thought, I tread, with great enthusiasm, on the path of skill-building and advanced learning in Data Science. With the scope of work in Data Science 
extending to data visualization, data mining, and information management, it is an added advantage to have previous experience in infrastructure design, cloud computing, and data 
warehousing. Information Technology’s growing relevance across all industries, regardless of their nature, scale or geographical locations makes it an extremely lucrative domain 
with rewarding career prospects. Moreover, in the era of rapidly evolving technology, skilled Data Scientists are in high demand for empowering corporate management with better 
decision-making, directing actions based on trends, identifying opportunities, and streamlining business processes with quantifiable, data-driven evidence.
Having acquired the foundation training in Computer Science with my undergraduate studies.  I strongly believe that my sound working knowledge in Machine Learning, Python and Math 
& Statistics give me an extra edge in the learning process as advanced training in Data Science includes computational, statistical, and professional practice aspects, including 
ethics and legal requirements.

My determination to become an Engineer has been my ambition since the time I was first introduced to the captivating concepts of Information Technology. Under the same pursuit, I 
secured the first rank at the school level in National Cyber Olympiad-2015. An innate interest in coding gravitated me towards opting Computer Science as my undergrad major. Over 
time, as I gained technical expertise in the same, I started working on building a strong knowledge base in Data Science and Machine Learning. The curriculum of the undergraduate 
program covering subjects like Algorithms and Designs, Data Structure, DBMS and Machine Learning inspired me to work on various kinds of projects. 
As a part of the coursework, I developed my minor project ‘Face Mask Detection’ which demonstrated my sound working knowledge of TensorFlow and Keras. Roaring success of the 
project led me towards newer assignments and subsequently, I designed a ‘Digit Recognizer System’ that strengthened my hold over neural networks. With mastery over Python skills, 
I worked on a ‘Face Recognition Application’ using principle component analysis. This was followed by my work on a project on ‘House Price Prediction System’ using linear 
regression, and ‘Survival Prediction in Titanic’ using logistic regression and decision tree. 

Extensive project work not only gauged my technical knowledge’s application in a practical arena but also taught me a lot about team building and leadership qualities. Chasing a 
set goal with limited resources and strict timelines provided an insight into the real-life work environment. It was also a motivation to keep up with the latest industry trends 
and demands. Around the same time, I was encouraged to participate in several college-level and regional competitions that demonstrated my excellent coding skills. I won a gold 
badge in Hackerrank (problem-solving) and a silver badge in Hackerrank (Python basics).

Speaking of my work exposure so far, I joined as a Trainee Intern at Codenscious.ai, an IT company in Indore working exclusively on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I 
was a part of the team working on ‘Face Detection’ project. The work experience here acquainted me with the latest techniques in Statistics, Python, Machine Learning, Deep 
Learning networks, etc. This was followed by my association with Kirloskar Brothers Private Limited, Dewas, India, which is one of the leading manufacturers of pipes and water 
material. I was bestowed with the responsibility of developing an appointment portal.

Amidst the global pandemic, I channelized my knowledge and technical expertise in analyzing the COVID-19 patients’ data. In collaboration with my peers, I worked on a research 
paper on COVID-19 patient status analysis which shows whether the patient has been treated or is no more. Based on various factors like the patient’s age, gender, sickness 
duration, residential place, etc., we applied Machine Learning algorithms to categorize the output after the initial data scrubbing. This germinated my interest in Data Science 
which I am excited to pursue further. 

Outside the scope of academics and career, I like to dance in my leisure time. I also enjoyed travelling to new places in the pre-Corona times. Being a competitive person, I 
dedicate myself completely towards my ambitions and do not settle until I accomplish them. Being a meticulous person by nature, I like to maintain a constant tab of my 
achievements and ambitions, as they constantly motivate me to hustle towards my career goals. 
And last but not the least I am pursuing my Masters of Science in Big Data Analytics from San Diego State University, San Diego, California.
