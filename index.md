###  PROJECTS

**Project Area**: Opinion Analysis of electric vehicle using Machine Learning(Research Paper Published in International Research and Journals, Pune, India) 
**Tools Used**: Python3 and Google Colab 
**Monetary Benefit**: The basic idea behind this research was to consider a view of people about electric vehicle. The major output was time required to charge the electric vehicle must be reduced. 

**Project Area**: Face Mask Detection
**Tools Used**: Python
 **Monetary Benefit**: This was software used to check whether the person entering the premises of the company was wearing a mask or not and if not he was not allowed to enter premises. 

**Project Area**: COVID-19 Patient Status Analysis
**Tools Used**: Python3 and Google Colab 
**Monetary Benefit**: Predicting the status of the covid-19 patient using his features like age, gender, time of admission, and many more. Status like whether he is recovered, dead or still affected.

**Project Area**: Appointment portal
**Tools Used**: Python3, Jupyter Notebook, and Tkinter
**Monetary Benefit**: Appointment is requested by the appointee and then the managerâ€™s assistant assigns the appointee a scheduled appointment by mail.  

**Project Area**: Face Recognition 
**Tools Used**: Python3, Jupyter Notebook 
**Concepts Used**: Machine Learning Algorithms, Principal component analysis, Clustering.
**Monetary Benefit**: Recognized with 90+ accuracy  Concepts of feature reduction and dimensionality reduction was used.  It first captures 10 images of any person and with the concepts of PCA and clustering, it saves the features of that person with the help of a pickle file.  For recognition, we just need to click one photo and it will show the name.
