## Hello Everyone

I am Aradhya Agrawal a graduate student in Big Data Science at San Diego State University, San Diego, California.  

I have completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from Medicaps University, Indore, India.

I love Playing Chess and Love to Travel.

### CAREER OBJECTIVE

To obtain a position that will enable me to use my strong organizational skills, educational background, and ability to work well with people & a positive contribution to the 

organization. Work in research and development for the betterment of society and the country.


###  PROJECTS

**Project Area**: Opinion Analysis of electric vehicle using Machine Learning(Research Paper Published in International Research and Journals, Pune, India) 

**Tools Used**: Python3 and Google Colab 

**Monetary Benefit**: The basic idea behind this research was to consider a view of people about electric vehicle. The major output was time required to charge the electric vehicle must be reduced. 


**Project Area**: Face Mask Detection

**Tools Used**: Python

**Monetary Benefit**: This was software used to check whether the person entering the premises of the company was wearing a mask or not and if not he was not allowed to enter premises. 

**Project Area**: COVID-19 Patient Status Analysis

**Tools Used**: Python3 and Google Colab 

**Monetary Benefit**: Predicting the status of the covid-19 patient using his features like age, gender, time of admission, and many more. Status like whether he is recovered, dead or still affected.

**Project Area**: Appointment portal

**Tools Used**: Python3, Jupyter Notebook, and Tkinter

**Monetary Benefit**: Appointment is requested by the appointee and then the manager’s assistant assigns the appointee a scheduled appointment by mail.  

**Project Area**: Face Recognition 

**Tools Used**: Python3, Jupyter Notebook 

**Concepts Used**: Machine Learning Algorithms, Principal component analysis, Clustering.

**Monetary Benefit**: Recognized with 90+ accuracy  Concepts of feature reduction and dimensionality reduction was used.  It first captures 10 images of any person and with the concepts of PCA and clustering, it saves the features of that person with the help of a pickle file.  For recognition, we just need to click one photo and it will show the name. 

#### About My Story 

Inspired by the aforementioned thought, I tread, with great enthusiasm, on the path of skill-building and advanced learning in Data Science. With the scope of work in Data Science 

extending to data visualization, data mining, and information management, it is an added advantage to have previous experience in infrastructure design, cloud computing, and data 

warehousing. Information Technology’s growing relevance across all industries, regardless of their nature, scale or geographical locations makes it an extremely lucrative domain 

with rewarding career prospects. Moreover, in the era of rapidly evolving technology, skilled Data Scientists are in high demand for empowering corporate management with better 

decision-making, directing actions based on trends, identifying opportunities, and streamlining business processes with quantifiable, data-driven evidence.

Having acquired the foundation training in Computer Science with my undergraduate studies.  I strongly believe that my sound working knowledge in Machine Learning, Python and Math 

& Statistics give me an extra edge in the learning process as advanced training in Data Science includes computational, statistical, and professional practice aspects, including 

ethics and legal requirements.

My determination to become an Engineer has been my ambition since the time I was first introduced to the captivating concepts of Information Technology. Under the same pursuit, I 

secured the first rank at the school level in National Cyber Olympiad-2015. An innate interest in coding gravitated me towards opting Computer Science as my undergrad major. Over 

time, as I gained technical expertise in the same, I started working on building a strong knowledge base in Data Science and Machine Learning. The curriculum of the undergraduate 

program covering subjects like Algorithms and Designs, Data Structure, DBMS and Machine Learning inspired me to work on various kinds of projects. 

As a part of the coursework, I developed my minor project ‘Face Mask Detection’ which demonstrated my sound working knowledge of TensorFlow and Keras. Roaring success of the 

project led me towards newer assignments and subsequently, I designed a ‘Digit Recognizer System’ that strengthened my hold over neural networks. With mastery over Python skills, 

I worked on a ‘Face Recognition Application’ using principle component analysis. This was followed by my work on a project on ‘House Price Prediction System’ using linear 

regression, and ‘Survival Prediction in Titanic’ using logistic regression and decision tree. 


Extensive project work not only gauged my technical knowledge’s application in a practical arena but also taught me a lot about team building and leadership qualities. Chasing a 

set goal with limited resources and strict timelines provided an insight into the real-life work environment. It was also a motivation to keep up with the latest industry trends 

and demands. Around the same time, I was encouraged to participate in several college-level and regional competitions that demonstrated my excellent coding skills. I won a gold 

badge in Hackerrank (problem-solving) and a silver badge in Hackerrank (Python basics).


Speaking of my work exposure so far, I joined as a Trainee Intern at Codenscious.ai, an IT company in Indore working exclusively on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I 

was a part of the team working on ‘Face Detection’ project. The work experience here acquainted me with the latest techniques in Statistics, Python, Machine Learning, Deep 

Learning networks, etc. This was followed by my association with Kirloskar Brothers Private Limited, Dewas, India, which is one of the leading manufacturers of pipes and water 

material. I was bestowed with the responsibility of developing an appointment portal.


Amidst the global pandemic, I channelized my knowledge and technical expertise in analyzing the COVID-19 patients’ data. In collaboration with my peers, I worked on a research 

paper on COVID-19 patient status analysis which shows whether the patient has been treated or is no more. Based on various factors like the patient’s age, gender, sickness 

duration, residential place, etc., we applied Machine Learning algorithms to categorize the output after the initial data scrubbing. This germinated my interest in Data Science 

which I am excited to pursue further. 

Outside the scope of academics and career, I like to dance in my leisure time. I also enjoyed travelling to new places in the pre-Corona times. Being a competitive person, I 

dedicate myself completely towards my ambitions and do not settle until I accomplish them. Being a meticulous person by nature, I like to maintain a constant tab of my 

achievements and ambitions, as they constantly motivate me to hustle towards my career goals. 

And last but not the least I am pursuing my Masters of Science in Big Data Analytics from San Diego State University, San Diego, California.
